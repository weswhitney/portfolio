  <h2 class="blog-post-title">My Story</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    My initial experience with higher education falls within the business field, and culminated in a Bachelors degree in Business Management.
    Historically I worked in the hospitality industry and out of that I have polished customer service skills.
    A return to education at gSchool left me with a renewed sense of eagerness to pursue a career that would meet both my need to feel challenged, and provide me with a specific skill set.
    gSchool has done this with a solid 6 month base of immersive development training, and exposed me to the culture and workflow of the tech industry.
    I have dedicated myself to this process by committing to absorb every drop of information and experience this program has made available to me.
    I continue to learn during all free moments as I aspire to be great at what I do.
    With the commencement of the program I'm adding a technical skill to my business and customer service background, I now need to begin working in a position where I can use my new honed skills with the added benefit of continuing to learn on the job.

    I am seeking a position with a mezzanine level start up to allow me first hand experience and exposure to the start up world.
    I am equally interested in positions within software agencies that would enable me to expand my knowledge surrounding development.
    I desire an atmosphere and culture that is focused on employee development, as I know one of my main assets is my loyalty and desire to reinvest in those who invest in me.

      I grew up in Colorado enjoying all that it has to offer.  I worked my way through college
      affording a few classes here and there until I reached my goal
      and graduated from Metro State University of Denver with a Bacholers in business
      management.

      Family became my number one priorty soon after when my first child was born.
      I was determined to spend as much time with my kid as possible,
      raising her in the day and working
      nights in the hospitality industry as bartender.

      Growing up in the technical revolution I decided it was my time to get involved
      in such an awesome forward thinking industry.  Luckily, my hometown of Denver
      is the perfect place to accomplish this.  I enrolled in gSchool to get an
      opportunity and start in the Industry and I couldn't be happier.

      a career that suites me.  Now I just need my first opporunity to get into the
      mix and finalize my tranistion.
