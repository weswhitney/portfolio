  <p>
    I grew up in Colorado enjoying all that it has to offer.  I was an all state
    high school athelete and snowboarding pioneer.  I worked my way through college
    affording a few classes here and there until I finally reached my goal
    and graduated from Metro State University of Denver with a Bacholers in business
    management.

    Family became my number one priorty soon after when my first child was born the same year
    my father passed away.  Realizing that life didn't last forever I was determined
    to spend as mush time with my kid as possible, raising her in the day and working
    nights in the hospitality industry as bartender.

    Growing up in the technical revolution I decided it was my time to get involved
    in such an awesome forward thinking industry.  Luckily, my hometown of Denver
    is the perfect place to accomplish this task.  I enrolled in gSchool to get an
    opportunity and start in the Industry and I couldn't be happier.

    I enjoy learning and music so I feel relived and excited that I finally got into
    a career that suites me.  Now I just need my first opporunity to get into the
    mix and finalize my tranistion.
